We created this CloudFormation file to allow an easy and automated deployment process of our [custom Rsyslog AMI product](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07YN9CCV4/){:target="_blank"} - available in the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=80edcebf-11fb-4c36-a3f4-49eb40b518a3). 

You can find the full documentation of how to use our product here: [documentation.0x4447.com](https://documentation.0x4447.com/products/cloud/aws-marketplace/rsyslog-server.html).

# Feature of the stack

Once deployed the stack will create a EC2 instance automatically for you thanks to the LaunchConfiguration file and the AutoScaling service which is configure to always have a minimum of 1. Meaning the Rsyslog server will always be available. If the instance get terminated the autoscaling will recreated it with the same configuration. 

**IMPORTANT**: all the unique server configuration is stored in a S3 bucket. Thanks to this if our software detects that the data is in the bucket, it will use what is in the bucket - this  way your clients will be able to reconnect to the instance automatically with minimal downtime. 

# How to deploy

All you need to do to deploy this stack is click the button to the left and follow the instructions that CloudFormation provides in your AWS Dashboard. Alternatively you can download the CF file from [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/0x4447-drive-cloudformation/rsyslog-server.json).

# What will deploy?

- 1x CloudWatch Dashboard.
- 3x CloudWatch Alarms.
- 1x S3 Bucket.
- 1x SNS Topic.
- 1x IAM Role
- 1x Security Policy
- 1x EC2 instance with 0x4447 custom Rsyslog AMI.

# Pricing

Once the stack is deployed you will pay for the AWS resources created in your account, plus you will get charged monthly for the 0x4447 Rsyslog custom AMI, the price willvarry based o the instance type hat you'll select when deploying the stack. Check the [product page](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07YN9CCV4/) to find out about the pricing options.

# How to generate the CloudFormation file

This repo was build using the [Grapes Frameworks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@0x4447/grapes). To create a CF file locally, first you need to install the framework:

```
sudo npm install -g @0x4447/grapes
```

Then go inside this repo and run this command

```
grapes -s .
```

This will create a `CloudFormation.json` file in the root dir of the repo.
